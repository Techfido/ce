Neo, on the other hand, supports most advanced programming languages like <strong>C++, Java, and Python</strong>. We believe this to be a huge positive for Neo because there are many more programmers who prefer to use a language they already know.&nbsp;<div>The <strong>Consensus Mechanism</strong> Neo uses is different from Ethereum, Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. The most common consensus mechanism at the moment is <strong>Proof of Work (PoW)</strong>. Bitcoin and Ethereum use PoW as a way to verify transactions. ‘Miners’ use their computers to work out algorithms, which ultimately finalise transactions. Each transaction goes into a block, which when full builds the blockchain.  Many people argue this to be the most decentralized way of running a cryptocurrency, but there are drawbacks. The electricity used to keep these PoW cryptocurrencies going is unbelievably high. To give you an idea of Bitcoin’s incredible use of electricity: it is believed that <strong>by 2020, miners will use as much energy as Denmark to power Bitcoin only.</strong> Not good for the carbon footprint.</div><div><br><div><strong><br></strong></div></div></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div><strong>Neo uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) Consensus Mechanism</strong>. This method uses <strong>bookkeeping nodes to run its blockchain by validating transactions.</strong> They are delegated into place by users of Neo, and must work for the good of Neo. PoS is becoming more popular with other cryptos, and even Ethereum is believed to be making a switch from PoW to PoS. These validating nodes stake their currency, which also helps keep the price more stable. Both <strong>PoW</strong> and <strong>PoS</strong> do have one similar major flaw, however. If an agreement cannot be reached by miners or bookkeeping nodes, internal fights occur. And the politics within sometimes ends in a chainsplit. We have seen this in recent times with Ethereum / Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin / Bitcoin Cash.</div><div>This is another Neo has the upper hand. Neo uses the <strong>Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) for its PoS mechanism</strong>. The dBFT offers not only <strong>lower electricity prices</strong> than other PoS means, but it also<strong> removes the possibility of a chain split</strong>. The dBFT system understands the problematic nature of achieving consensus in distributed systems. Therefore, bookkeeping nodes are the ones who make the decisions, as they are appointed by ordinary nodes through a form of delegated voting.&nbsp;</div><div>What’s more, with every newly forged block, one of the bookkeeping nodes is appointed as the <strong>“Chairman” node</strong> and broadcasts its version of the blockchain to the rest of the network for approval. This system creates stability within the ecosystem and makes it virtually impossible for a chain split. It’s not just bookkeeping nodes who can make bonuses, however. Ordinary nodes are Neo holders, who stake Neo in their <strong>Neo wallet</strong>. Just by doing this, they are generating <strong>GAS</strong>, which is a dividend paid out to each holder. Each GAS earned can be used as a currency to power one’s transaction on the NEO blockchain, or it can also be traded against other cryptocurrencies.</div><div><strong><br></strong></div></div>

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div>While there are no guarantees in anything, especially in the cryptosphere, we here at <strong>CryptoEase</strong> are especially excited about NEO, because it is <strong>China’s main crypto</strong>. If you don’t know much about China internally, it’s probably because the <strong>Chinese government</strong> want it to be that way. Now, foreign companies do succeed in China, but realistically, nowhere near as much as anywhere else in the world. And this is because China prefers to use its own companies. They have some of the world’s most profitable companies that most of us would never have heard of. They have the four largest banks in the world: ICBC, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China. Some other notable Chinese companies: Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, to name a few.&nbsp;</div><div>Most people in the western world have never heard of ‘WeChat’. It’s an App owned by Tencent, and it generates more revenue than Facebook. You see China doesn’t really need western investment to become huge companies, but luckily for crypto investors, we know of NEO, and other Chinese cryptos, through trading sites, and we believe that when China fully accepts cryptocurrencies, NEO will be at the forefront, and us investors will reap the benefits.</div><div><br></div></div>
